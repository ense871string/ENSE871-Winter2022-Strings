**Problem description**
Our primary goal is to make the project and profile page eye-catchy, apart from that making website more user-friendly. Lastly, by implementing some visuals and features to enhance the customer engagement and make the strong presence of RCE Saskatchewan in this digital world.

**North star customers:** The volunteers, the organizers, and all the people who are connected with the project.

**Carryover customers:** educators, local communities, and other users who want to know more about SDG and UN goals or general users.

**Activity 1: observe & frame**
Based on data, information, and knowledge gathered from the project discussion teams will compile project insights via affinity diagramming and empathy mapping activities and create a user story mapping illustrating key Minimum Viable Products.

**Activity 2: Brainstorming/Divergence**

Propose site navigations/site maps as well as low-fidelity interface designs (paper and pencil). Update the user story mapping illustrating key Minimum Viable Products as needed.

**Activity 3: Brainstorming/Divergence*
